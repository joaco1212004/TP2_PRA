"""
Gazebo in the custom cafe, the recorded map, and RViz showing both.

This is the only launch file in the package and the only thing anyone has to
run:

    ros2 launch custom_map cafe.launch.py

It picks the simulator that works on the machine it is started on. Gazebo
Fortress on macOS initialises ogre2 on a secondary thread and Cocoa only allows
window creation on the main thread, so there it has no GUI and no rendering
sensor -- `/scan` never publishes. Gazebo Classic opens its window and its CPU
raycast lidar needs no rendering at all. So macOS gets Classic and everything
else gets Fortress. Override with `backend:=classic` or `backend:=fortress`.

`map -> odom` is a fixed identity transform, on purpose. The robot's pose in the
map is therefore its raw odometry, which drifts -- that is the point, so the
drift can be watched against /ground_truth/odom and corrected by hand. Nothing
here estimates a pose, and nothing here should: no AMCL, no SLAM, no Nav2.

Nothing in this package requires the rest of the workspace to be rebuilt. The
Fortress simulation is included from yahboom_rosmaster_gazebo's installed share
directory, and the model path is extended here rather than in the environment
activation script.
